# Timemorph

**Timemorph** is a dynamic, self-organizing timetable system built in Go that adapts to user feedback over time. It uses genetic programming principles to evolve an optimal schedule based on the userâ€™s input and interaction with the system. The project is designed to help users create flexible timetables that adjust to their real-world behavior and needs.
